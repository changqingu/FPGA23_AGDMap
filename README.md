# FPGA23_AGDMap
An executable binary for AGDMap, which is published in FPGA'23.

How to reproduce our resutls:

abc> read design.blif  
abc> resyn;resyn2  
abc> dchoice  
abc> agd -v (-a) [or mapping by if -K 6 (-a), for abc lossless synthesis]  

Note that the choices generated by dchoice will be ignored by AGDMap.   
This binary shall have exactly same results with the FPGA paper. If not, please contact me [lffan20@fudan.edu.cn]  for check.
